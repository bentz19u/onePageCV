            Welcome ! My name is Daniel and this is my story.<br>
        Originaly, my first interest was about biological science but my expectations were far different from the actual work so i decided to do something different.<br><br>
        My second interest since i was young has been computer science and multimedia.<br>
        I love structure and order and I also stand for quality. I love spending time on fixing little details and optimizing apps.<br><br>
        So after a retraining, I worked for around 6 years in a company which makes software for hospitals.<br>
        Then i decided to complete my knowledge and I am currently studying for a bachelor's degree in web development and I am looking for an internship in web or mobile development.<br>
        I am very interested in foreign culture  and I want to expand my horizons by working abroad in a near future.<br>
