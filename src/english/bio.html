            Welcome! My name is Daniel,and this is my story.<br>
        Originally, my interest was about biological science but my expectations were far different from the actual work, so I decided to do something different.<br><br>
        My second interest since I was young has been computer science and multimedia.<br>
        So after retraining, I worked for approximately 6 years in a company which makes software for hospitals.<br>
        Then I decided to complete my education, and I am currently studying for a bachelor's degree in web development. I am looking for an internship in web or mobile development.<br><br>
        I love structure, order, and quality. I love spending time on fixing little details and optimizing apps.<br>
        I am very interested in foreign culture, and I want to expand my horizons by working abroad in a near future.<br>
