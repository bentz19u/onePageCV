Hello, world!

I have worked around 6 years in a commpany which makes software for hospitals and that experience taught me a lot of things about a company's work, development and how a project can be made from scratch.
I am very interested in foreign culture	 and I want to expand my horizons by working abroad. 
At the moment, I am studying for a bachelor's degree in web development and I am looking for an internship in web or mobile development.
